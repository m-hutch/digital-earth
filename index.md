# Welcome to Digital Earth
This course will introduce you to the topics and concepts in digital earth and geospatial technologies that are becoming increasingly important tools in research, policy, and everyday life. The topics will cover digital earth and geospatial data sources (ex., GPS, citizen science, satellite imagery, government agencies, social media, and semantic web), methods and applications (ex., disaster relief, biodiversity conservation, disease spread), and implications (ex., privacy, ethical, legal issues). Students will gain experience compiling/collecting and analyzing analog, digital, and geospatial data as a mechanism to understand and research our physical and social world. Spatial problem-solving will be emphasized and analyses will address real-world issues in which geospatial technologies have played an important role. Finally, cartographic methods and tools to create maps that can be used to communicate data, ideas, and concepts to officials and policy makers will also be discussed.
